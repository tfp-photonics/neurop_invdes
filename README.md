# Surrogate solvers for electromagnetic field inference and inverse design

This repository contains the code for the paper "A neural operator-based surrogate solver for free-form electromagnetic inverse design" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01934)).

## Installation

To run the code, set up a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment from the provided environment file and activate it:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -p your_env_prefix
conda activate your_env_prefix
```

For data generation, use the environment file `env_datagen.yml` provided [here](./data_generation/).
Note that the environment files specify strict version requirements - this is simply because everything has been tested using those versions.
It is likely that everything works fine for different versions (of PyTorch, for instance), but we can make no guarantees.

## Usage

We provide the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) batch scripts that were used to perform all the computations in the paper [here](./slurm/).
While these probably won't run on your particular setup without modification, they should provide enough insight on how to use the data generation, training and inverse design scripts.

### FNO & UNet training

To train a surrogate solver, use the file `train_surrogates.py`, see `./train_surrogates.py --help` for a list of parameters.
In the simplest case, using just the defaults, you can train an `FNO-2D` model by simply providing a path to the dataset:
```bash
python3 train_surrogates.py --data-dir /path/to/data
```
Note that the dataloaders used here expect the following folder structure:
```
data
├── train
│   ├── train_data_0.h5
│   ├── train_data_1.h5
│   ├── etc.
└── test
    ├── test_data_0.h5
    ├── test_data_1.h5
    └── etc.
```

### VAE training

The VAE models can be trained using `train_vae.py`, see `./train_vae.py --help` for a list of parameters.
You can simply run the file without providing any arguments, which will train a 2D VAE.

### Inverse design

For inverse design, use the file `inverse_design_3d.py`.
We do not currently provide an implementation for 2D inverse design, but it should be straightforward to adapt the current 3D implementation.
Please note that this file needs pre-trained FNO and VAE models in [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) format.
